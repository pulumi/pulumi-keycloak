/**
 * This data source can be used to fetch policy and permission information for an OpenID client that has authorization enabled.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * In this example, we'll create a new OpenID client with authorization enabled. This will cause Keycloak to create a default
 * permission for this client called "Default Permission". We'll use the `keycloak.openid.getClientAuthorizationPolicy` data
 * source to fetch information about this permission, so we can use it to create a new resource-based authorization permission.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as keycloak from "@pulumi/keycloak";
 *
 * const realm = new keycloak.Realm("realm", {
 *     realm: "my-realm",
 *     enabled: true,
 * });
 * const clientWithAuthz = new keycloak.openid.Client("clientWithAuthz", {
 *     clientId: "client-with-authz",
 *     realmId: realm.id,
 *     accessType: "CONFIDENTIAL",
 *     serviceAccountsEnabled: true,
 *     authorization: {
 *         policyEnforcementMode: "ENFORCING",
 *     },
 * });
 * const defaultPermission = clientWithAuthz.resourceServerId.apply(resourceServerId => keycloak.openid.getClientAuthorizationPolicy({
 *     realmId: keycloak_realm.test.id,
 *     resourceServerId: resourceServerId,
 *     name: "Default Permission",
 * }));
 * const resource = new keycloak.openid.ClientAuthorizationResource("resource", {
 *     resourceServerId: clientWithAuthz.resourceServerId,
 *     realmId: keycloak_realm.test.id,
 *     uris: ["/endpoint/*"],
 *     attributes: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * const permission = new keycloak.openid.ClientAuthorizationPermission("permission", {
 *     resourceServerId: clientWithAuthz.resourceServerId,
 *     realmId: keycloak_realm.test.id,
 *     policies: [defaultPermission.id],
 *     resources: [resource.id],
 * });
 * ```
